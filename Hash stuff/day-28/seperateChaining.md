-> To prevent collisions, we use seperate chaining to store key values in an array or any data structure.
- its not so different from doubly linked list if we are only talking about the structure.


-> Hash Node
- A hash node in hash table has three data members.
- K key : it is a unique value which helps in storing data.
- V value : it is the data that is stored based on location computed by key. 
- next : it refers to the next node in chain of hash nodes.
