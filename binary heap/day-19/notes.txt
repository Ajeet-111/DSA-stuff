-> Priority queue
- it is a data structure that allows us to find min/max element among a collection
of elements in constant time.

-> operations
- insert(key)
- deleteMax()
- deleteMin()
- getMax()
- getMin()

-> Binary Heap
- it is a data structure that helps us in in implementing priority queue efficiently.
- it is a completebinary tree in which each node value is >= or <= than the value of its childs.

-> min Heap
- when the nodes in a tree have less value than its child nodes.

-> max Heap
- when the nodes in a binary tree have value greater than its children.

-> Complete binary tree
- when all the levels in a binary tree are complete except last levels
- the last level should have left nodes tho.
