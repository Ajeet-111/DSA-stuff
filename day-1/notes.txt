1. Data structures help us organize, maintain and search our data in a better way.

-> there are two types of data structures;
- Linear : Arrays, linked list, stack and queue.
- non linear : tree and graph.

2. Algorithms: it is set of instructions to perform a task or to solve a problem.

-> Analysis of algorithm is finding the best algorithm to solve a particular problem.
- time and space complexity.

- time complexity -> amount of taken taken by algorithm to perform the task.
- space complexity -> memory or space taken by algorithm to run.

3. Asymptotic notations: mathematical tools used to describe the running time of an algorithm in terms of input size.
- Best case
- Average case
- Worst case

-> notations
- omega -> best case (least used).
- big O -> worst case (most used).
- theta -> both (not usually used).

-> Big O notation
- time complexity;
- let's say if T = xn^2 + n + y then time complexity  = O(n^2);
- any constant results in a time complexity of O(1).
- any loop will give the time complexity of O(n).
- any operation gives a time comeplexity of O(1).
